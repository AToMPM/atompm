v0.5.4
======
*getCount() and toggleIncUpdate() commands, get more information by typing help in the input bar. If you turn off the incremental updates and your trafo doesn't have a stop, you can pause/stop the trafo, get intermediate changelogs and see that model. (of course it doesnt have an optimization logic in this, so you can get a max recursion OR memory exception very fast, which will not be visible to GUI, but it works)
*web page updated!

v0.5.3
======
*Check for updates button in MainMenu toolbar.
*A bug in BRule that causes exception is fixed (code name: mmTypeData bug).
*All default toolbars now uses non-deprecated functions.
*Cardinality fix in SimpleClassDiagram.umlIcons
