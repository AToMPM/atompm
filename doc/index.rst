AToMPM Documentation
====================
AToMPM ("A Tool for Multi-Paradigm Modelling") is a (meta)modelling workbench, which allows language developers to create visual domain-specific languages, and domain experts to use these languages. A language is defined by its *abstract syntax* in a metamodel, its *concrete syntax(es)*, which define(s) how each abstract syntax element is visualized, and its *semantics definition(s)*, either operational (a simulator) or translational (by mapping onto a known semantic domain). AToMPM supports model transformations to model semantics.

This documentation serves to introduce AToMPM to the two main user groups: language developers and language users.
